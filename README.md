# Lepaya Challenge

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.
Using the Typescript version.

No backend was implemented, for simplicity the numbers are generated inside the Redux action.
In a real world scenario I would implement a simple REST API using Node and Express.

A React Single Page Application was developed with the following details:

- Libraries chosen for the frontend were Redux with Toolkit for state management (it comes with ImmerJS, super nice) and Styled Components for styling.
- Added Redux Persist to persist the turn history across page reloads.
- No component library installed.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

First install all dependencies:

### `yarn install` or `npm install`

The run the dev server:

### `yarn start` or `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
